# challenge_onda_horiseon

In this challenge, we dived into HTML scemantic tags. These tags have no affect on the HTML structure, but rather they serve a=an intangible value. They help the web page get found via seo. So its important to use the correct tag for each portion. i.e. <main ></main> for the main portion of the web page.

We also learned how to link html to css. Css is how one makes various graphical changes to a web page. 
When you make changes from a div tag to a section tag i.e. you must make the corresponding change in css.
